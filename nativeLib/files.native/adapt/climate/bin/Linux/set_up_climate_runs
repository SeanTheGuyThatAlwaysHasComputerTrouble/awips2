# set_up_climate_runs
#
# This is the script to set up the climate runs for the climate program.
#
# Modification History:
# ---------------------
# 12/05/2002  OB2  Bob Morris         - Changed from csh to sh
#                                     - Removed CLIMATE_BIN_DIR definition, it
#                                       is set in readenv.sh. 
#                                     - Added file tests.
#                                     - General cleanup.
# 01/27/2003  OB2  Bob Morris         Changes so kill pid works in both BASH, HP
#
#
#
# 09/04/2003 OB3  Mohammed Sikder     A new segment of code is added in order 
#                                     to explicitly pipe the generated outputs
#                                     from a set of climate scripts to a logfile.
#                                     Te reason behind that was some of the nested
#                                     GUIs in the climate was failing to get
#                                     displayed at NGIT OB3 test platform.
#
