The "<b>Addressee</b>" field (e.g., ALL) is used to route the product to the specified addressee. <br>

Select the "<b>Include Temp in deg C?</b>" option to output the temperature in the Remarks field, 
in degrees Celsius.  A "Y" selection does not necessarily result in the output of the temperature in degrees Celsius
becasues the output "Remarks" section can contain a maximum of two weather elements 
based on a fixed priority order, with the temperature in degrees Celsius having the 
lowest priority. <br>
<br>
Select the "<b>Express Sky as Fair when SCP Missing?</b>" field to have the word "FAIR" output 
when the SCP observation is missing and the ASOS observation is clear or partly cloudy.  
Otherwise, when the SCP is missing, the sky/weather will be output as missing.<br>
<br>
Select the "<b>Time Zone</b>" pushbutton to choose from the list of available time zones one 
to be used in the product. <br>
<br>
Select the <b>"Std Time All Yr?</b>" field to prevent the product from switching to Daylight 
Savings Time during the year. <br>
<br>
By default, if observations are more than 1 hour old, they are considered invalid and are not 
used in the HWR.  However, since C-MAN, buoy, and ship observations are not necessarily reported 
every hour, the number of hours prior to creation time over which marine observations 
are to be considered valid can be entered in the "<b>Window for Marine Obs</b>" field.
