The weather element phrases for fixed stations and marine stations
are defined in one or more broadcast records per product.  Some of the phrases 
will only be formatted if threshold criteria for selected weather elements are met. Program hwrnwr will select the 
correct sky/weather format based on the current sky/weather condition.<br>
<br>
Product "CCCHWRXXX" contains a template for the broadcast format. You can copy and modify the template 
to meet your needs, or you may create your own broadcast records.<br>
<br>
/KDCA/At %ID%, { %SW% was falling; %SW% was reported; it was %SW% skies; %SW% were reported}<br>
  ([VV], reducing the visibility to %VV%U).<br>
  The temperature was %TF%U, the dewpoint %DF%, and the relative humidity %RR% percent,	<br>
  ([HF], producing a heat index of %HF%). <br>
  ([FF]The wind was %DD% at %FF%U([GG], gusting to %GG%),<br>
  ([WF] producing a wind chill of %WF%).<br> 
  The pressure was %PP%U and %PT%.$$<br>
<br>  
%ID%, %SW%, %VV% are some of the symbolic words described in Figure 1-1 of the user documentation.  For
example %ID% will be replaced with the station name for the station identifier "KDCA"
(e.g., Reagan National Airport).<br>
<br>
"{%SW% was falling; %SW% was reported; it was %SW%; %SW% were reported}" are four possible 
phrases for the program hwrnwr to output depending on the observed weather.  The first phrase will be used when 
precipitation is falling (e.g., heavy snow was falling).  The second phrase will be used generally for 
obstructions to vision (e.g., blowing snow was reported). The third phrase will be used to broadcast sky
conditions (e.g., it was partly cloudy).  The fourth phrase will be used to report weather conditions
stated in the plural (e.g., drizzle and fog were reported).<br>
<br>
The phrases in parentheses (e.g., visibility) are threshold phrases will only be output if the weather element in the brackets 
reaches or exceeds a forecaster-specified threshold.  The threshold is specified in the GUI.<br>
<br>
The above examples contain threshold phrases imbedded within other threshold phrases. Consequently, in the 
above example, the gust phrase will be broadcast only if the wind speed meets or exceeds 
the forecaster-specified threshold (e.g., [FF]) and if the gust speed meets or exceeds the forecaster-specified 
threshold (e.g., [GG]).<br>
<br>
"~$$" signifies the end of the station's phrases.<br>
