The Listening Area Code "<b>LAC</b>" field is a map to the broadcast towers.  There must be
corresponding CRS entries for the LACs used here.  One product can go to multiple 
towers by putting in multiple LACs.<br>
<br>
The "<b>Expiration:</b>" field represents the number of minutes that are to be added to 
the nominal hour in order to determine the expiration time of the product.  
Enter the value by either directly typing it in or by incrementing/decrementing
via the up and down arrows.  The allowable range of this field and its default 
value used in the GUI are specified in the xhwrnwr.conf file.<br>
<br>
The "<b>Summary Format Temp Range</b>" field represents the range of 
temperatures at or below which the temperatures for a group of stations will be 
summarized in the output product.  Enter the value by either directly typing it in
or by incrementing/decrementing via the up and down arrows.  The allowable range 
of this field and its default value used in the GUI are specified in the 
xhwrnwr.conf file.<br>
<br>
Use the "<b>Time Zone</b>" pushbutton to choose the time zone to be used in your product
from a list of available time zones.<br>
<br>
Select the "<b>Std Time All Yr?</b>" field to prevent the product from switching to Daylight 
Savings Time during the year. <br>
<br>
By default, if observations are more than 1 hour old, they are considered invalid and are not 
used in the HWR.  However, since C-MAN, buoy, and ship observations are not necessarily reported 
every hour, the number of hours prior to creation time over which marine observations 
are to be considered valid can be entered in the "<b>Window for Marine Obs</b>" field.<br>
<br>
Select the "<b>Express Sky as Fair when SCP Missing?</b>" field to have the word "FAIR" output 
when the SCP observation is missing and the ASOS observation is clear or partly cloudy.  
Otherwise, when the SCP is missing, the sky/weather will be output as missing.<br>
