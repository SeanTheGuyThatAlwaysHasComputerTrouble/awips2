C Common block:  "platform"
C
C notes:        (1)     This common block is used to store information
C                       about a machine's platform.  Such information is
C                       used in conditional statements to perform
C                       machine- or OS-dependent commands.
C               (2)     Initialize this common block by calling SETPLAT
C                       from the main program.
C               (3)     The values in the common block should be set in
C                       the defaults file for NWSRFS, as follows:
C
C                               opersys         nwsrfs_platform
C
C               (4)     If on a UNIX system, set the value of opersys to
C                       the operating system name returned by the
C                       "uname" command.
