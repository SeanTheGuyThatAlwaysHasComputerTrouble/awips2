Usage
=====

cdbgen creates *.pgc files capable of creating, reading, updating, and deleting
records from tables within an active database.

The cdbgen.sh script will search the given project directory for *_CDB.cfg 
files.  *_CDB.cfg files contain the settings for connecting to the database and
the directory into which the generated *.pgc and *.h files are to be placed.

*_CDB.cfg example:

    db_host=localhost
    db_name=hd_ob83empty
    db_user=awips

    output_dir=../src/IHFSDbGenerated
    header_dir=../inc/dbms

A *_CDB.cfg file may have an accompaning *_CDB.txt file containing a list of 
table names writtin in the preffered case.  For example a table with the name
hourlylog in the database may have an HourlyLog entry in the *_CDB.txt file.

If the output_dir exists cdbgen will not run.  The output and header directories
can be relative paths rooted at the location of the *_CDB.cfg file.

The cdbgen.sh script must run before Eclipse generates the makefiles.  See the 
build/docs for instructions on setting up cdbgen.sh with Eclipse.

Directory and File Structure
=============================
[cdbgen]                    - cdbgen root directory

    build.xml               - ant build script
    gluegen.jar             - pre-built gluegen jar
    
    [db_drivers]            - jdbc db driver jars availble for use by cdbgen
    
                              To use another jdbc driver add the jar here,
                              rebuild the gluegen.jar file, and adjust the
                              cdbgen.sh script's db_driver_class_name and
                              connection_url variables
                              
    [src]                   - cdbgen source
    
    The following directories are created during the ant build process:
    
    [build]                 - compiled cdbgen class code
    [dist]                  - cdbgen jar file

Re-Building
===========

Change the db_drivers property in the build.xml script as needed to point to
the location of the db_driver that will be used.  Update the cdbgen.sh script
if the driver changes from Postgres.

Run ant from the gluegen directory.  After ant finishes move the cdbgen-*.jar 
file from the dist directory into the cdbgen root directory.  Rename it to 
cdbgen.jar
