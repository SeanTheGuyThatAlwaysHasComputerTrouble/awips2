      SUBROUTINE PRDH26(STOR,ELEV)
C***********************************************************************
C SUBROUTINE PRDH26 USES PRESCRIBED RATE OF CHANGE OF ELEVATIONS 
C TO DETERMINE DISCHARGES FROM A RESERVOIR.
C FOR THE ADJUSTED RUN PRIOR TO RUN TIME, POOL STORAGES PASSED TO
C THIS SUBROUTINE MAY BE OBSERVED, COMPUTED FROM OBSERVED MEAN OUTFLOWS
C AND ADJUSTED MEAN INFLOWS, INTERPOLATED BETWEEN OBSERVED VALUES,
C OR MISSING.  POOL ELEVATIONS WILL BE OBSERVED OR MISSING.  MEAN OUT-
C FLOWS MAY BE OBSERVED OR COMPUTED FROM ADJUSTED MEAN INFLOWS AND
C OBSERVED OR ADJUSTED STORAGES.  MEAN OUTFLOWS FOR THE TIME INTERVAL,
C POOL STORAGE, POOL ELEVATION, AND INSTANTANEOUS OUTFLOW AT THE END OF
C THE TIME INTERVAL ARE PASSED TO THIS SUBROUTINE IN THE VARIABLES QOM,
C S2, ELEV2, AND QO2, RESPECTIVELY.  MISSING VALUES ARE PASSED AS -999.0
C***********************************************************************
C THIS SUBROUTINE WAS ORIGINALLY PROGRAMMED BY
C     KUANG HSU -- HRL APRIL 2000
C***********************************************************************
C VARIABLES PASSED TO OR FROM THIS SUBROUTINE ARE DEFINED AS FOLLOWS:
C     FCST -- LOGICAL VARIABLE.  IF TRUE, TIME PERIOD IS IN THE FORECAST
C       TIME.
C     NS2 -- POSITION IN ARRAYS AT END OF TIME PERIOD.
C     QIM -- MEAN INFLOW FOR TIME PERIOD.
C     QO2 -- OUTFLOW AT END OF TIME PERIOD.
C     QOM -- MEAN OUTFLOW FOR TIME PERIOD.
C     S1 -- STORAGE AT BEGINNING OF TIME PERIOD IN UNITS OF MEAN
C       DISCHARGE FOR THE TIME PERIOD.
C     S2 -- STORAGE AT END OF TIME PERIOD IN UNITS OF MEAN DISCHARGE FOR
C       THE TIME PERIOD.
C     ELEV1 -- ELEVATION AT BEGINNING OF TIME PERIOD.
C     ELEV2 -- ELEVATION AT END OF TIME PERIOD.
C     STOR -- STORAGES FOR STORAGE VS ELEVATION CURVE IN UNITS OF MEAN
C       DISCHARGE FOR THE TIME PERIOD.
C     ELEV -- ELEVATIONS FOR STORAGE VS ELEVATION CURVE.
C     NSE -- NO. OF PAIRS OF STOR AND ELEV VALUES.
C     NTERP -- INDICATES ARITHMETIC (NTERP=0) OR LOGARITHMIC
C       INTERPOLATION (NTERP=1).
C     IBUG -- NO TRACE OR DEBUG (IBUG=0), TRACE ONLY (IBUG=1),TRACE AND
C       DEBUG (IBUG=2).
C***********************************************************************
C EXCEPT WHEN OBSERVED VALUES ARE AVAILABLE, QO2,QOM,S2, AND ELEV2 WILL
C BE COMPUTED IN THIS SUBROUTINE.  OTHER VARIABLES IN THE ARGUMENT LIST
C WILL HAVE VALUES FURNISHED BY THE SUPERVISORY EXECUTION ROUTINE.
