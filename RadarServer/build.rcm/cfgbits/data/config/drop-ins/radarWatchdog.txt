# Controls how long to wait for products specified on the RPS list before
# sounding an alarm.  There are two sections: One defines VCP durations
# and one that lists products to monitor.
#
# VCP duration format: <VCP number>|<duration in seconds>
#
# Product format: <product mnemonic>
#
# <product mnemonic> is a mnemonic found in radarInfo.txt.
#
#
# If a product is listed, but is not actually in the current RPS list,
# it will not be monitored.
