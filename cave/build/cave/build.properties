# Parameters describing how and where to execute the build.
# Typical users need only update the following properties:
#    baseLocation - where things you are building against are installed
#    bootclasspath - The base jars to compile against (typicaly rt.jar)
#    configs - the list of {os, ws, arch} configurations to build.  
#
# Of course any of the settings here can be overridden by spec'ing 
# them on the command line (e.g., -DbaseLocation=d:/eclipse

############## BUILD NAMING CONTROL ################

# Type of build.  Used in naming the build output.  Typically this value is
# one of I, N, M, S, ...
buildType=I

# ID of the build.  Used in naming the build output.
buildId=CAVE

# Label for the build.  Used in naming the build output

# Timestamp for the build.  Used in naming the build output

#The value to be used for the qualifier of a plugin or feature when you want to override the value computed by pde.
#The value will only be applied to plugin or features indicating build.properties, qualifier = context

#The generated suffix is computed according to the content of the feature   
#generateFeatureVersionSuffix=true

############# BASE CONTROL #############
# Settings for the base Eclipse components and Java class libraries 
# against which you are building.
# Base location for anything the build needs to compile against.  For example,
# in most RCP app or a plug-in,  the baseLocation should be the location of a previously
# installed Eclipse against which the application or plug-in code will be compiled and the RCP delta pack.

#Os/Ws/Arch/nl of the eclipse specified by baseLocation
baseos=linux
basews=gtk
basearch=x86

#this property indicates whether you want the set of plug-ins and features to be considered during the build to be limited to the ones reachable from the features / plugins being built
